        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          MATHOPHILE was founded when we saw a gap in the way math was being taught.
          We realized that traditional methods were often uninspiring and ineffective, leading to
          frustration and disengagement. We set out to change that by creating a platform that not only
          teaches math but also inspires a genuine interest in the subject.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          We envision a world where everyone has the mathematical skills they need to succeed in life.
          Whether you’re pursuing a career in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM), or
          simply want to improve your everyday problem-solving skills, MATHOPHILE is here to support you
          every step of the way.
